## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd mail-service
```

3. Create a virtual environment named `myVenv`:

```bash
python -m venv myVenv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run:

```bash
myVenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
source myVenv/bin/activate
```

You should see the virtual environment name (e.g., `myVenv`) in your command prompt, indicating that it's active.

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API Endpoints

### List of API Endpoints
Here's a list of API endpoints available in the project:

### Trains and Parcels

- `POST /scheduling/create_train/`: Create a new train.
- `POST /scheduling/create_owner/`: Create a new parcel owner.
- `POST /scheduling/create_parcel/`: Create a new parcel.
- `GET /scheduling/list_trains/`: List all trains.
- `GET /scheduling/list_parcels/`: List all parcels.
- `POST /scheduling/book_train/`: Book a train for a parcel.
- `GET /scheduling/get_train_status/<int:train_id>/`: Get the status of a specific train.
- `GET /scheduling/get_parcel_status/<int:parcel_id>/`: Get the status of a specific parcel.
- `GET /scheduling/get_cost_of_shipping/<int:parcel_id>/`: Calculate the cost of shipping for a parcel.
- `GET /scheduling/get_total_cost_of_shipping/<int:owner_id>/`: Calculate the total cost of shipping for parcels belonging to an owner.

### Auctions and Bidders

These endpoints allow you to interact with various aspects of the Mail Service application, including managing trains, parcels, auctions, and bidders, as well as calculating shipping costs and parcel withdrawal.

## Business Logic

Describe the core business logic of the project, including algorithms and processes.

### Knapsack Algorithm for Cost Calculation
Imagine you have a list of different items (in this case, trains) with their weights, volumes, and costs. You also have a parcel with a certain weight and volume. Your goal is to find the best combination of items (trains) to carry the parcel, minimizing the cost.

The knapsack algorithm helps you solve this problem efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization:** First, we calculate the maximum possible total weight and volume of all available trains. We create a table (dp) to store the minimum cost for different capacities and train options. Initially, all values in this table are set to infinity.

2. **Dynamic Programming:** We iterate through each train and consider whether to include it in the solution or not. For each train, we calculate the minimum cost to carry the parcel with the given weight and volume. We update the dp table with this minimum cost.

3. **Backtracking:** Once we've filled the dp table, we find the minimum cost (the last cell with a value less than infinity). We then trace back to identify which trains were selected to achieve this minimum cost.

4. **Result:** The result is the minimum cost to carry the parcel and the list of selected trains that achieve this cost.

In simpler terms, the algorithm helps you find the most cost-effective way to ship a parcel by choosing the right combination of trains based on their weight, volume, and cost. It considers all possible combinations and selects the one with the lowest cost. This is useful for logistics and shipping optimization.
### Hungarain Algorithm for Assignment 
Imagine you have a list of available trains and a list of parcels that need to be shipped. Each train and parcel have different characteristics like weight, volume, and other factors. Your goal is to find the best way to assign parcels to trains to minimize the overall shipping cost.

The Hungarian algorithm helps you achieve this by following these steps:

1. **Create a Cost Matrix:** To start, we create a table (matrix) called the "cost matrix." This matrix represents the cost of assigning each parcel to each train. The cost is calculated based on various factors like the difference in weight and volume between the train and parcel.

2. **Find Optimal Assignment:** The algorithm then finds the optimal assignment of parcels to trains that minimizes the total cost. It ensures that each parcel is assigned to only one train, and each train carries at most one parcel.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:** After finding the assignment, the algorithm calculates the total cost by adding up the costs of the chosen assignments. This total cost represents the minimum cost to ship all parcels.

4. **Result:** The result is a list of train indices and parcel indices, indicating which parcel is assigned to which train to achieve the lowest overall cost.

In simpler terms, the Hungarian algorithm helps you figure out the most efficient way to match parcels with trains to reduce shipping expenses. It takes into account various factors and ensures that each parcel is handled by a suitable train, resulting in cost savings and better logistics.

### Online Bidding System Logic

Imagine you want to sell an item, like a vintage comic book or a rare collectible, to the highest bidder. An online bidding system helps you do this efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **Auction Setup:** You, as the seller, create an online auction listing for your item. You set the starting bid, which is the minimum amount you're willing to accept for the item.

2. **Bidders Join:** People who are interested in your item join the auction. They can see the starting bid and decide if they want to participate.

3. **Bidding:** Bidders start placing bids. Each bid is a specific amount of money they're willing to pay for the item. Bids must be higher than the previous highest bid.

4. **Winning Bid:** The bidder with the highest bid at the end of the auction wins the item. This person is the "winner."

5. **Payment:** The winner is expected to pay the amount of their winning bid to you, the seller. This is how they officially purchase the item.

6. **Item Transfer:** You, as the seller, arrange to transfer the item to the winner. This might involve shipping it to their address or arranging a meetup.

In simple terms, an online bidding system is like an exciting game where people compete to buy an item by offering higher and higher amounts of money. The highest bidder wins the item and pays for it. It's a fun and interactive way to sell valuable or unique items to interested buyers.
