Project Setup:
Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment named myVenv:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myVenv
Save to grepper
Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows, activate the virtual environment by running:

bash
Copy code
myVenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux, activate the virtual environment with:

bash
source myVenv/bin/activate
or 
bash
.\myVenv\Scripts\activate  

You should see the virtual environment name (e.g., myVenv) in your command prompt, indicating that it's active.

Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, you can now install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Make sure you are in your project directory (where requirements.txt is located), and run:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

This is just an outline, and you should elaborate on each section by providing detailed information, code examples, explanations, and any other relevant content. Make sure to organize your documentation logically and use proper formatting for clarity.

Remember that documentation is an ongoing process. You should update it as your project evolves, and new features or changes are introduced. Well-documented projects are easier to maintain, contribute to, and understand by other developers.
