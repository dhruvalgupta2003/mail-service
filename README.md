## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd mail-service
```

3. Create a virtual environment named `myVenv`:

```bash
python -m venv myVenv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run:

```bash
myVenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
source myVenv/bin/activate
```

You should see the virtual environment name (e.g., `myVenv`) in your command prompt, indicating that it's active.

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
